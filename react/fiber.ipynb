    "\n",
    "UpdateQueue is a linked list of prioritized updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "like fibers, update queues come in pairs: a current queue, which represents the visible state of the screen,\n",
    "and a work-in-progress queue, which can be mutated and processed asynchoronously before it is committed - a form of double buffering.\n",
    "if a work-in-progress render is discarded befor finishing, we create a new work-in-progress by cloning the current queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "both queues share a persistent, singly-linked list structure. to schedule an update, we append it to the end of both queues.\n",
    "each queue maintains a pointer to first update in the persistent list that hasn't been processed.\n",
    "the work-in-progress pointer always has a position equal to or greater than the current queue,\n",
    "since we always work on that one. the current queue's pointer is only updated during the commit phase, \n",
    "when we swap in the work-in-progree.\n",
    "\n",
    "the reson we append to both queues is bacause otherwise we might drop updates without ever processing them. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Prioritization**\n",
    "\n",
    "updates are not sorted by priority, but by insertion; new updates are always appended to the end of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "the priority is still important , thought. when processing the update queue during the render phase, only the updates \n",
    "with sufficient priority are included in the result. if we skip an update because it has insufficient priority , \n",
    "it remains in the queue to be processed later, during a lower priority render. crucially , all updates subsequent to a skipped update also\n",
    "remain in the queue *regardless of their priority*. that means high priority updates are sometimes processed twice , at two separate priorities.\n",
    "we also keep track of a base state, that represents the state before the first update in the queue is applied.\n",
